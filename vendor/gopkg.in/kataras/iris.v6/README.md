Iris is fully vendored. That means it is independent of any API changes in the used libraries and **will work seamlessly in the future**!

The size of the executable file is a critical part of the Application Deployment Process,

I made two very simple identical applications, the first written with a famous mini web framework named `gin`(=a Router, with logger, recover and pure Context out-of-the-box support) and the second in `iris`
(=every feature that you will need at the first place is bundled when you install Iris. Including sessions, websockets, typescript support, a cloud-editor, the view engine with 5 different template parsers, two Routers to select from, an end-to-end framework to test your API, more than 60 handy helpers via Context, complete rest API implementation, and cors, basicauth, internalization i18n, logger and recover middleware out-of-the-box).

I ran `go build` for both of them,

 - _gin_ had `9.029 KB` overall file size,
 - _iris_ had `8.505 KB` overall file size!
 - _net/http_ had produced an executable file with `5.380 KB` size.


> The app didn't used any third-party library. If you test the same thing I test and adapt other features like sessions and websockets then the size of `gin` and `net/http` could be doubled while `iris`' overall file size will remain almost the same.


**Applications that are written using Iris produce smaller file size even if they use more features** than a simple router library!

> Q: How is that possible?

> A: The Iris' vendor was done manually without any third-party tool. That means that I had the chance to remove any unnecessary code that Iris never uses internally.


Always follows the latest trends and best practices. Iris is the **Secret To Staying One Step Ahead of Your Competition**.


Iris is a high-performance tool, but it doesn't stops there. Performance depends on your application too, **Iris helps you to make the right choices** on every step.

**Familiar** and easy **API**. Sinatra-like REST API.

Contains examples and documentation for all its features.

Iris is a `low-level access` web framework, you always know what you're doing.

You'll **never miss a thing** from `net/http`, but if you do on some point, no problem because Iris is fully compatible with stdlib, you still have access to `http.ResponseWriter` and `http.Request`, you can adapt any third-party middleware of form `func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request, next http.HandlerFunc)` as well.

Iris is a community-driven project, **you suggest and I code**.

Unlike other repositories, this one is **very active**. When you post an issue, you get an answer at the next couple of minutes(hours at the worst). If you find a bug, **I am obliged to fix** that on the same day.

> Q: Why this framework is better than alternatives, does the author is, simply, better than other developers?

> A: Probably not, I don't think that I'm better than anyone else, I still learning every single day. The answer is that I have all the world's time to code for Iris the whole day, I don't have any obligations to anybody else, except you. I'd describe my self as a very dedicated FOSS developer.

Overview
-----------

```go

func main() {
	// Receives optional iris.Configuration{}, see ./configuration.go
	// for more.
	app := iris.New()

	// Order doesn't matter,
	// You can split it to different .Adapt calls.
	// See ./adaptors folder for more.
	app.Adapt(
		// adapt a logger which prints all errors to the os.Stdout
		iris.DevLogger(),
		// adapt the adaptors/httprouter or adaptors/gorillamux
		httprouter.New(),
		// 5 template engines are supported out-of-the-box:
		//
		// - standard html/template
		// - amber
		// - django
		// - handlebars
		// - pug(jade)
		//
		// Use the html standard engine for all files inside "./views" folder with extension ".html"
		view.HTML("./views", ".html"),
		// Cors wrapper to the entire application, allow all origins.
		cors.New(cors.Options{AllowedOrigins: []string{"*"}}))

	// http://localhost:6300
	// Method: "GET"

	})

	// Group routes, optionally: share middleware, template layout and custom http errors.
	userAPI := app.Party("/users", userAPIMiddleware).
		Layout("layouts/userLayout.html")
	{
		// Fire userNotFoundHandler when Not Found
		// inside http://localhost:6300/users/*anything
		userAPI.OnError(404, userNotFoundHandler)

		// http://localhost:6300/users

}

func userAPIMiddleware(ctx *iris.Context) {
	// your code here...
	println("Request: " + ctx.Path())
	ctx.Next() // go to the next handler(s)
}

func userNotFoundHandler(ctx *iris.Context) {

	// userRepo, imaginary database service <- your only job.
	user := userRepo.GetByID(userID)

	// send back a response to the client,
	// .JSON: content type as application/json; charset="utf-8"

```

### Reload templates on each incoming request

```go
app.Adapt(view.HTML("./views", ".html").Reload(true))
```


Third Party Middleware
------------

Iris has its own middleware form of `func(ctx *iris.Context)` but it's also compatible with all `net/http` middleware forms using [iris.ToHandler](https://github.com/iris-contrib/middleware/blob/master/cors/cors.go#L33), i.e Negroni's middleware form of `func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, next http.HandlerFunc)`.

Testing
------------

You can find End-To-End test examples by navigating to the source code.

A simple test is located to [./httptest/_example/main_test.go](https://github.com/kataras/iris/blob/v6/httptest/_example/main_test.go)


Read more about [gavv's httpexpect](https://github.com/gavv/httpexpect).


Philosophy
------------

The Iris philosophy is to provide robust tooling for HTTP, making it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs. Keep note that, today, iris is faster than nginx itself.

Iris does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for the most used template engines (6+), you can quickly craft the perfect application.

The Success of Iris belongs to YOU with your bug reports and feature requests that made this Framework so Unique.

#### Who is kataras?

Hi, my name is Gerasimos Maropoulos and I'm the author of this project, let me put a few words about me.

I started to design Iris the night of the 13 March 2016, some weeks later, iris started to became famous and I have to fix many issues and implement new features, but I didn't have time to work on Iris because I had a part time job and the (software engineering) colleague which I studied.

I wanted to make iris' users proud of the framework they're using, so I decided to interrupt my studies and colleague, two days later I left from my part time job also.

Today I spend all my days and nights coding for Iris, and I'm happy about this, therefore I have zero incoming value.

- Star the project, will help you to follow the upcoming features.
- [Donate](https://github.com/kataras/iris/blob/master/DONATIONS.md), if you can afford any cost.
- Write an article about Iris or even post a Tweet.
